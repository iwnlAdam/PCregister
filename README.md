# PCregister
This code gives you the ability to create an overview of PCs in a system//not done

Keep in mind that I have not made a specific database for this program. When you run the code it will automatically create a txt document where you can see the saved data (PCs and Status).

How to use the program:
Write "search" to enter the name of the pc. Then the program will search trough the database and find the pc you are searching for. If the code can't find the pc in the system it will ask you to register the pc instead. 
Write "register" to register a new pc. It will then save the PCs name in the database. 
When you register a new PC, the program will ask you to enter the status of the PC. The status will also be saved to the database.
